# Handling-Complex-Images---Happy-or-Sad-Dataset
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emoji-like faces as either "Happy" or "Sad" with 99.9% accuracy. The dataset contains 80 images, evenly split between happy and sad faces. The project stops training once the accuracy threshold is met.
